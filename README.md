# QOSF Cohort 7 Screening Task Submission

We have the following task description for **Task 3** from [Cohort 7 Screening Tasks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KBot_q-CQ7FSmAXK45PDHNu8VKedOEbh/edit):

Generate a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) using the [iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) and try to propose a kernel from a parametric quantum circuit to classify the three classes (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using the one-vs-all format, the kernel only works as binary classification. Identify the proposal with the lowest number of qubits and depth to obtain higher accuracy. You can use the UUâ€  format or using the [Swap-Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_test).
